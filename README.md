#

### Reasoning
Substance Designer have very few hotkeys, and it is not possible to change keymaps in Substance Designer. So, the best way to integrate the hotkeys is to change it in Blender

Refer [this guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-designer/getting-started/shortcuts.html) to see all the available hotkeys in Substance Designer 

#

### Hotkeys to modify in Blender

#### Functions - `New Hotkey` (Conflicting Functions - `New Hotkey for Conflict`)

#

Find Node - `Spacebar`( Use Node Tabber addon from https://github.com/williamchange/node_tabber ) 

Reroute - `Alt Left Drag` (Detach - `Cmd Alt Left Drag`)

Delete with Reconnect - `Backspace`(Reset Nodes - `Cmd Backspace`)


Duplicate with Link- `Ctrl D` (Add driver - `Ctrl Cmd D`)

Duplicate without Link - `Ctrl Shift D`

#
_Troubleshooting: The above 2 shortcuts revert back to their original on every login. Solution is to use the following add-on which will change the keys to above mentioned everytime you press_ `Cmd Alt Spacebar` 

Download the add-on: [`Dulicate Hotkey Fix.py`](https://github.com/abhiraaid/Designer-Hotkeys-in-Blender/releases/tag/duplicate-hotkey-fix-py)
#

Mute/disable nodes - `Shift D`

Toggle Hidden Node Sockets - `D`

Frame All - `F` (Make Links - `Cmd F`)

#

P.S. - `Cmd` key is also known as `Win`, `Super`, `OS`
