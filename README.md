##Hotkeys to modify in Blender

###Functions to Modify in Blender - `Hotkey` (Conflicting Functions - `New Hotkey for Conflict`)

Find Node - `Spacebar`( Use Node Tabber addon from https://github.com/williamchange/node_tabber )Â 

Reroute - `Alt Left Drag` (Detach - `Cmd Alt Left Drag`)

Delete with Reconnect - `Backspace`(Reset Nodes - `Cmd Backspace`)


Duplicate with Link- `Ctrl D` (Add driver - `Ctrl Cmd D`)
